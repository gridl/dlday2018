## Deep Learning Day [preliminary, stay tuned!!]

We are pleased to announce then third run of deep learning day on Friday the 28th of September 2018. The event will be hosted in Winterthur and will be organised in a cooperation of the ZHAW Winterthur and the HTWG Konstanz.

As for the previous events, we would like to have an **active participation** and encourage you to send in an abstract for a poster or talk by latest 26th of August. Note that the **number of participants will be limited to 60** persons and attendees with active presentation will be given preference.  

### Focus

The focus of the workshop is on sharing experience with other fellow deep learners and to connect with each other. We therefore plan a poster session during a extended apero. As in the last two events, we will arrange an extended hands-on tutorial session on the latest developments in a deep learning framework such as Tensorflow or Pytorch (stay tuned). 

### Previous event
* [2017](https://tensorchiefs.github.io/dlday2017/)
* [2016](https://sites.google.com/site/sdsdlday2016/) 

#### Contributions
We are looking for poster / talk contributions on all areas of deep learning. This time we want to set a focus on *probabilistic* aspects of deep learning such as probabilistic modeling or assigning uncertainties to predictions and especially welcome contributions from these fields. However, we welcome all deep learning related contributions.   

Please submit an abstract as described in [abstract submission](abstract)
