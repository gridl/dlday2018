## Deep Learning Day 2018 

We are pleased to announce the third **Deep Learning Day on Friday the 14th of September 2018.** 

The event will take place at **ZHAW School of Engineering in Winterthur** (for details see below) and is organised by the ZHAW Winterthur and the HTWG Konstanz.

As for the previous events, we would like to have an **active participation** and encourage you to **send in an abstract for a poster and/or a talk** by latest 26th of August. Note that the number of participants will be limited to 50 persons (first come first serve) and attendees with active presentation will be given preference.  

### Focus

The focus of the workshop is on sharing experience with other fellow deep learners and to connect with each other. There will be sessions with contributed talks and alsa a poster session during an extended apero. 

We are happy to announce that Thomas Fischbacher from Google will give a tutorial on the latest developments in Tensorflow which will include a hands-on part - so please bring your laptops with you.


#### Contributions
We are looking for poster/talk contributions on all areas of deep learning. This time we want to set a focus on *probabilistic* aspects of deep learning such as assigning uncertainties to predictions. Contributions from these fields are especially welcome, however we welcome all deep learning related contributions.   

Please submit an abstract as described in [abstract submission](abstract)
