## Tutorial 2: TensorFlow Beyond Basics

This TensorFlow workshop will allow candidates to get hands-on experience with somewhat advanced uses of TensorFlow. We will cover
writing custom loss functions, gradient checking and debugging, using TensorFlow's (extended) Einstein summation convention to great effect,
and implementing C++ extension operations.


More information will follow.
