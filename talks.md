The existence of adversarial attacks on convolutional neural
networks (CNN) questions the fitness of such models for serious applications.
The attacks manipulate an input image such that misclassification
is evoked while still looking normal to a human observer—they are thus
not easily detectable. In a different context, backpropagated activations
of CNN hidden layers—“feature responses” to a given input—have been
helpful to visualize for a human “debugger” what the CNN “looks at”
while computing its output. In this work, we propose a novel detection
method for adversarial examples to prevent attacks. We do so by tracking
adversarial perturbations in feature responses, allowing for automatic
detection using average local spatial entropy. The method does not alter
the original network architecture and is fully human-interpretable.
Experiments confirm the validity of our approach for state-of-the-art attacks
on large-scale models trained on ImageNet.

In this paper, we introduce a novel object detection method, based on synthetic energy maps and the watershed transform, 
called Deep Watershed Detector (DWD). Our method is specifically tailored to deal with high resolution images that contain 
a large number of very small objects. Therefore it is well suited to process full pages of written music. We present 
state-of-the-art detection results of common music symbols and show DWD's ability to work with synthetic scores equally 
well as with handwritten music.
