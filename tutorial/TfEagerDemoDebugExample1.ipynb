For simplicity, we assume that each digit has been written into its own box, which has been digitized independently, and there are only four digits in total.\n","\n","Let us also assume that these 4-digit account-numbers actually come with a built-in checksum: All valid account numbers are divisible by 9. Having this extra knowledge should somehow be exploitable by ML, so if a handwritten account number could be read as either '2519' or '2619', the model should be able to have learned that '2519' cannot be a correct interpretation.\n","\n","If the probabilities to recognize each single digit correctly were independent, then a single-digit success rate of 96% would mean that the odds of recognizing a 4-digit number correctly is 0.96^4, i.e. about 85%. However, this is not what we would expect in reality, since the difficulty to recognize digits written by the same person is not uncorrelated. For people with very clear handwriting, we would expect to easily recognize just about every 4-digit number they write, while for people with bad handwriting, we would expect a high probability to have two or more barely-recognizable digits in the number.\n","\n","There are many different ways for designing the architecture of such a ML model. Here, we want to do it as follows:\n","\n","\n","*   While we have to recognize four digits, we want these four sub-problems to use the same trainable parameters, so we in effect only train one handwritten-digit-recognizer.\n","*   For each of the 4 digits, we get a 10-dimensional vector of logits (think: accumulated evidence) for the digit to be a 0, 1, 2, etc. We explicitly map these to probabilities.\n","*   We want to have two contributions to the overall loss-function: Cross-entropy loss on the predicted digits as before, plus some extra loss that depends on whether the 4-digit number as it was read is divisible by 9.\n","*   We expect that most problems come from single-digit errors, such as mis-reading a '5' as a '6' in '5112'. While we could try to design a network that could in principle figure out that it needs to have another very close look at the pixel data to determine whether the '2' is really a '2' or rather a '3', or alternatively the '5' is really a '5' or rather a '6' in the number '2510', we want to consider this as beyond our scope. Rather, we want something that only tweaks the predicted likelihoods for the 1st digit to be a 0, a 1, a 2, etc. according to what the other digits likely are - and correspondingly for the 2nd digit, etc.\n","*  Strictly speaking, we should have a logit for each possible output-number from '0000' to '9999'. Nevertheless, we use an architecture where we always make the crude assumption that the probability for a given number is the product of the probabilities for all the digits, and the 'divisible-by-9' constraint is implemented as adjustments to single-digit probabilities found by looking at the probability-distribution for all the digits.\n","*   So, after we obtained the 4x10 logits for the likelihoods for the thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones to be a particular digit, we want to have some other layer(s) that predict corrections to these logits. In training this correction-predicting part, we add a loss that punishes predicting numbers not divisible by 9.\n","\n","This approach may be neither the smartest nor the simplest thing to do for such a problem. The simplest approach likely would be to pick the 4-digit number with highest predicted likelihood that is also divisible by 9.

With ML, computers may be good (often better than humans) to mostly do the right thing, statistically speaking. But this can come with some occasional very strange behavior. Deep Learning as it is implemented in this toy example is good at finding some correlations in the input data which allow making predictions that are correct with high probability. In Engineering applications, we need to be very careful to not just make assumptions, ignoring that they may be violated in practice. Many ML applications are of the form \"Let us find some mapping from many numbers (such as for example: image data) to (for example) some probability\". The trained model will map any input to some output. If it only ever saw a tiny part of all theoretically possible inputs in training, we must not expect it to show desirable behavior when encountering data that is very different from training examples. Even when restricting ourselves to some kind of \"plausible input subspace\", such as (for example) all images that we can obtain from interpolating between known training examples, we can expect that with a bit of effort, it is possible to construct input examples where the model's behavior diverges strongly from our expectations (since the model is only doing reasonably well statistically, not necessarily for individual points - especially if we are looking for such points).
